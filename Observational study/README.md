
### microbial data cleaning & diversity & MaAsLin2.r
This script contains three separate sections:
1) Microbial data cleaning: Cleans the gut microbial data from four studies, respectively.
2) Descriptive analyses: Calculates and visualizes alpha and beta diversity.
3) MaAsLin2 Analysis: Conducts association analysis between smoking and gut microbiota using the MaAsLin2.

### meta analysis & plots.r
This script performs the following tasks:
1) Meta-Analysis: Collates results from four studies and conducts meta-analysis.
2) Regression Analysis: Performs regression analysis to examine the associations of the smoking-associated genera with the health-related outcomes and smoking-associated metabolites, using data from ZMSC.
3) Results Visualization: Generates plots to visualize the results.

### MR analysis.r
This script conducted Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigates the potential causal effects of the smoking-associated genera on various phenotypes available in Biobank Japan.

### Requirements
- R (version 4.1.2 / 3.6.0)
- Required R packages are included within the corresponding scripts.
